            <h2>Our Question + Insight from the graph</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a country with significant total energy consumption and high per capita energy use. Does this correlate with the happiness of its citizens? Let’s explore this intriguing question by analyzing various data visualizations from environment, finance, and living quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                This map highlights the relationship between <span class="highlight"> total energy consumption per capita</span> and <span class="highlight">happiness</span> across regions. Preliminary findings suggest a <span class="highlight">positive correlation</span>. Therefore, it is able for us to further study that there are several factors linking the relationship between happiness and energy consumption.

    <p>
        Why could higher energy consumption contribute to happiness, or not? To delve into this, we can look at relevant keywords. The cluster of terms related to "energy consumption" often includes "environment", "finances", and "quality of life." On the other hand, "happiness" is commonly linked with ideas such as "well-being," "life", and "health."
    </p>
    <p>
        Consequently, we can primarily identify three key factors: <span class="highlight">Environment, Finance, and Living Quality.</span>

        <h3>Total Energy Consumption & Happiness Score versus Air Quality</h3>
        <p>
            We evaluate the Air Quality Level using Air Quality Index. Our analysis reveals the following insights:
        </p>
        <p>
            From the graph, we found that the correlation between Energy Consumption and Air Quality Level is weak​. One of the reasons is the air quality level is not directly related to energy consumption. However, the air quality level is more related to the environment and the government's policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a clear layer indicating that a higher happiness score tends to have a better air quality level. It shows that people are more likely to be happy when they live in a clean environment.

        <h3>Total Energy Consumption & Happiness Score versus Finance & Living Quality </h3>
        <p>
            We analyze finance using three key factors: GDP*, the unemployment rate, and the CPI*. Additionally, we assess Living Quality using the HDI*. Our findings are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            We found the following positive correlations:<br>
            1. GDP with Total Energy Consumption<br>
            2. GDP per Capita / HDI with Total Energy Consumption per Capita<br>
            3. GDP per Capita / HDI with Happiness<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            It indicates that Energy Consumption may have a positive correlation to the Happiness according to the GDP and HDI relationship​. It is because the GDP and HDI are the main factors that affect the happiness of the country. Generally, higher GDP leads to better public services and job opportunities, while a higher HDI indicates improved education and health, both contributes to a better quality of life.<br>
            And the energy consumption is the main factor that affects the GDP and HDI. Because it drives industrial production, supports economic activity, and ensures access to essential services like education and healthcare, all contributs to economic growth and improved living standards. Higher energy consumption typically indicates greater economic output and the ability to invest in infrastructure and social programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, it shows that the higher energy consumption may lead to a higher GDP and HDI, which may lead to a higher happiness score.
